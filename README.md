# Java Priority Queue 
This repository holds an implementation of a priority queue structure in Java. This was an implementation I did for my undergraduate algorithms class in which we were tasked with creating a min priority queue that stores pairs (p,e) which consist of a priority and an element. The element was to be stored in the priority queue with the associated priority. All priorities and elements were assumed to be integers for simplicity.
